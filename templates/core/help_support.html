                    What is Specites, and how does it generate returns?

                <p class="faq-answer hidden mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    Specites is an investment platform that leverages price discrepancies (through arbitrage trading) across different trading platforms to generate returns. We use automated software to buy assets (crypto and stocks) at lower prices on one platform and sell them at higher prices on another. We also capitalize on pre-listing opportunities, purchasing assets before they are publicly available and selling them at a profit after they are listed. You can read more about this at the “about” section

                    How is Specites able to offer high fixed interest rates?
                    <span class="text-blue-500">+</span>
                </button>
                <p class="faq-answer hidden mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    Our ability to offer high interest rates is based on high-frequency arbitrage trading due to market inefficiencies. Since our trading strategy involves multiple transactions per week with minimal exposure to market volatility, we consistently generate profits. These profits allow us to provide fixed returns to our investors.

                <p class="faq-answer hidden mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    Like any financial investment, there are inherent risks. However, our model significantly minimizes risk by focusing on arbitrage opportunities rather than speculative trading. Additionally, we use sophisticated software that has being tested for years before we launched Specites plus a well-structured strategy to manage risks effectively.

                <p class="faq-answer hidden mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    1. You deposit funds into your Specites account, via the deposit page <br>
                    2. Choose any product or investment plan of your choice, via the Invest page <br>
                    3. Wait till the maturity date and both your money (the principal) and your interest will be paid into your balances automatically.

                </button>
                <p class="faq-answer hidden mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    When you deposit money, it goes into your withdrawable balance and can be withdrawn at any time whether or not you invest it. However, once you invest the money you can’t withdraw it until the maturity date is reached and after which, both the money and the interest earned on it will be moved to your withdrawable balance which you can withdraw.

                </button>
                <p class="faq-answer hidden mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    You can only cancel an investment plan of 30 days and above. In which case, before you can cancel it the investment would have lasted for at least 2 weeks (14 days), after which you can write us a mail or chat with our live customer support team and it’ll be cancelled for you. You should however be reminded that if you cancel your investment, you won’t be paid any interest - just your money (the principal).

                    We use software that we developed and have tested for years. The software scans hundreds of trading platforms daily to detect price discrepancies. It identifies where an asset is being sold at a lower price and where it can be sold at a higher price, allowing us to execute trades for profit.
