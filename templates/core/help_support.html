                    2. Choose any product or investment plan of your choice, via the Invest page <br>
                    3. Wait till the maturity date and both your money (the principal) and your interest will be paid into your balances automatically.

                    Can I cancel my investment at any time?
                    <span class="text-blue-500">+</span>
                </button>
                <p class="faq-answer hidden mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    You can only cancel an investment plan of 30 days and above. In which case, before you can cancel it the investment would have lasted for at least 2 weeks (14 days), after which you can write us a mail or chat with our live customer support team and it’ll be cancelled for you. You should however be reminded that if you cancel your investment, you won’t be paid any interest - just your money (the principal).
